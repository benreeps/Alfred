## Design 

This project was inspired and designed with components from an Arduino Braccio servo robot kit.

Shortly after assebling the kit, I decided to start designing my own robot in Autodesk Fusion 360. I had salvaged the digital servos, Arduino Uno and Braccio servo shield to be used for prototyping my own robot, Alfred.
